                  Agile Manifesto and Principles were defined more than two
                  decades back and with specific focus to improve software
                  development and delivery. However, with the disruptive
                  business environment that every industry is now operating in,
                  Being Agile has become a mandate for every business that wants
                  to thrive and excel. Agile & Agility are no longer proprietary
                  to software development or Information Technology industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We strongly believe that there is a need to review the
                  existing Manifesto and Principles to cater for all industries
                  while still retaining the essence of what we started off with.
                  Below is our attempt to review and revise the existing
                  manifesto and principles that were originally defined way back
                  in early 2000s.

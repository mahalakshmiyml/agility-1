                  <p>Being Agile is also about continuous learning and evolution. In order to help the community with their learning journey, we launched “SEEKERS - The Book Readers Club”.

                  A complete hands-on experiential learning program intended to

                  The program is being run using five themes, each consisting of
                  two iterations with specific goals and acceptance criteria to
                  be met by each member of the team. A mentor is assigned to
                  each team to coach, guide & mentor the team members on their
                  journey through the program.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This program is being run by volunteers who are acting as
                  mentors for the participants and validating the acceptance
                  criteria as having been met in each iteration. Participants
                  who successfully complete all the 10 iterations would be
                  awarded "Expert Scrum Master" Certification from Digital
                  Agility Institute as a recognition of their expertise

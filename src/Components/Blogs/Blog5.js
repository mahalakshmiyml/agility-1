              <p>
                Transformation is the buzzword whether it’s organizational or
                personal. There is enormous focus on transformation across the
                industry sectors with Digital, Agile, DevOps, Cloud
                transformation etc. at organizational level. This demands
                continuous upskilling and exhibiting behaviors with growth
                mindset at personal level to adapt & excel.
              </p>

              <p>
                As part of personal or organizational transformation,
                individuals and teams learn modern technologies, skills,
                behaviors and build competencies that are required for new ways
                of working and leading.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have been leading organizational transformation initiatives
                over the past 17 years and been on a personal transformation
                journey myself having to move across contrasting industry
                sectors, technologies and frameworks as part of my mid-life
                career shift.

                  I have seen and experienced that for transformation to be
                  complete and sustaining, while it’s important to learn new
                  skills, build capabilities, competencies in the new areas, it
                  is equally important to “Unlearn” the skills, competencies,
                  habits, behaviors that are incompatible with the new areas /
                  avenues.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have started writing a book on “Unlearning” to share my
                  experiences and the ways in which I have gone about it and how
                  it helped me excel. However, the book would define various
                  aspects of Unlearning, the why, the what and the How
                  subjectively. I was also looking for opportunities to create
                  greater awareness on the need for Unlearning in the community.
                  The idea of Unlearning Studio and the Meetup originated from
                  this perspective.

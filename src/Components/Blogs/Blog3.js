                  Reflecting back at the year gone by, it has been another
                  eventful year in both professional as well as personal life
                  where I looked to extend my horizons through some firsts in
                  life, overcoming limiting beliefs, few unlearnings and
                  understanding myself little more than the years before. It
                  also included few things that I couldn’t succeed in and
                  unfinished objectives which I look to carry forward to 2020.
                </p>

                <p>My Firsts This Year:</p>

                <p>
                  Half Marathon: Successfully finished my first half marathon
                  (21 Kms) as part of “Green Marathon” on Nov 17th clocking a
                  time of 2hrs 32 Min. This required more mental preparation
                  than physical, overcoming lots of mental blocks and focusing
                  on what I need to stop thinking as well as worrying about.
                  (detailed article soon on this).

                  talk on “Unlearning – Your learning is never complete without
                  it”. Met lots of great speakers, made new friends, learnt more
                  about the country culture as well.

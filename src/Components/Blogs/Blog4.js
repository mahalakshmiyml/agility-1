                    I can’t speak in a public forum, I am not as good as my
                    colleague, I am not a creative person, I can’t run a
                    Marathon, or I am too old to shift my career etc.

                    Do you have some thoughts that are similar to those above?
                    These are the thoughts that are driven by our self-limiting
                    beliefs.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I have attended number of conferences, talks and read books
                    where-in I felt that I knew the concepts earlier and in some
                    cases thought I could possibly present it better.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Our thoughts and behaviors are driven by our belief system.
                    A strong belief system has the ability to make your life
                    successful, define how successful it could be or destroy it
                    too.

                <p>What are limiting beliefs?</p>

                <p>
                  The beliefs that constrain you from taking certain actions
                  that could make you better, more successful and/or stop you
                  from realising your true potential are the limiting beliefs.
                  These could fall into two categories: the conscious and the
                  unconscious.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Conscious ones are those that you have knowledge about, you
                  know what is the belief system that is stopping you. The
                  unconscious ones are which you are not aware of.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Both the conscious and unconscious beliefs are ingrained in
                  our personality because of multiple factors right from our
                  early childhood:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Environment:</strong> The environment in which we
                    are brought up right from our early life defines our belief
                    system and is the most deep routed. This is because we
                    believe what we see as we lack judgement, logic,
                    understanding of right or wrong in that nascent state.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Experiences:</strong> The experiences we have at
                    distinct phases our life also influence/alter our belief
                    system to a great extent based how impactful those
                    experiences are.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Proximity:</strong> Our belief system is also
                    influenced by the proximity to people that we look up to for
                    inspiration and interact regularly in life.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Assumptions & Bias:</strong> These are also the
                    factors that influence our beliefs and defy our logic until
                    challenged right way.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  I have had more than one limiting beliefs that I overcame. The
                  one I could take you through as an example with the help of
                  the framework that helped is about{" "}
                  <strong>“publishing articles / videos on LinkedIn”</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I wanted to share my experiences with the network of people to
                  expand my knowledge base, to create a presence for myself and
                  expand my network. But I didn’t know what was stopping me from
                  doing it. I felt someone would have already written about the
                  subject I want to write on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I started reflecting on the reasons that stopped me from
                  writing and publishing articles on LinkedIn. The first one
                  that came up was the fear of being wrong. What if my
                  understanding of the concepts was wrong? What if the way I am
                  looking at the experience I am sharing is not the right
                  perspective?
                </p>

                <p>
                  The second one was the fear of being judged. How would people
                  look at me when I publish my views? What if it’s not perfect
                  and not properly presented?
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was now aware about the reasons why I wasn’t writing and
                  publishing what I know. For me to start thinking about
                  convincing myself to act on them, I had to think about the
                  worst-case scenario. I started digging deeper to understand
                  the outcomes if those fears do come true.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Reason 1:</strong> What if my understanding of the
                  concepts was wrong? What if the way I am looking at the
                  experience I am sharing is not the right perspective?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Outcome:</strong> It’s proven that I am wrong and
                  there is a better way of perceiving my experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Benefit:</strong> I would make effort to get
                  understanding right and become better at looking at my
                  experiences from different perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Reason 2:</strong> How would people look at me when I
                  publish my views? What if it’s not perfect and not properly
                  presented?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Outcome:</strong> I could be trolled by some, some
                  would empathise, and few would come forward to guide and
                  support
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Benefit:</strong> I am expanding my horizon by being
                  ok to be vulnerable and also accepting that there is nothing
                  like perfection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the above clarity and understanding, I could convince
                  myself to publish my first article. However, the topic I
                  choose to write on was the one which I had full confidence
                  about which meant that I was not still completely comfortable.
                  It took consistent reflection, convincing and practice to
                  reach a stage where I can write on whatever topic I can think
                  of. The more I wrote, the more comfortable I became.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Looking at the experience of having overcome few of my
                  self-limiting beliefs, I wanted to share the framework that
                  helped me successfully do that.

                <h3>Awareness (Chitta in Sanskrit):</h3>

                <p>
                  The first step to any change in life is awareness and it
                  involves self-introspection. Many a times, the biggest problem
                  is identifying the primary reason that is stopping us from
                  reaching our goals / realizing full potential. Right from
                  childhood, all our learning is through focusing our mind on
                  external things. Hence, our mind naturally looks outside.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Increasing your awareness involves process of unlearning than
                  learning. To create self-awareness, we need to look inward and
                  that can be accomplished using the power of our mind through
                  self-reflection. The more you concentrate on looking inward,
                  the greater is the awareness of self. As you on your journey
                  of self-discovery with a clear focus on what you are looking
                  to accomplish, you will generate awareness of what is stopping
                  you from getting there.
                </p>

                <h3>Acknowledgement (Svikriti in Sanskrit):</h3>

                <p>
                  This is the first level of acceptance. It comes from the
                  realization of the state of being of self. While you are
                  progressing through your self-discovery through reflection
                  process, you will find your limiting beliefs. The
                  acknowledgment comes from the realization of the state of your
                  limiting beliefs and the impact they have on your
                  accomplishments.
                </p>

                <h3>Acceptance (Anumodan in Sanskrit):</h3>

                <p>
                  This is the most critical and difficult aspect of the entire
                  process. This is about embracing reality as it is today in the
                  present and not resisting. Not accepting the reality of who
                  you are, what you are facing creates lot of conflict,
                  confusion which can lead to frustration and in some cased
                  depression too. It’s a well-known fact that “half the problem
                  is solved when you accept the mere existence of it”.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Accepting that we have limiting beliefs gives us the clarity
                  about our current state. This takes out our frustrations by
                  way of knowing where the issue is than feeling like wandering
                  in a desert. This also puts emphasis and ownership on us to
                  reflect and think if we want to take any action to overcome.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Human mind is trained always to look for excuses and laying
                  the blame on circumstances, people around us, society for
                  whatever is happening or not happening in our life. Going
                  through the above steps gives the sense of reinforcement, it’s
                  for us to define our goals, take actions and achieve them. All
                  external aspects can influence the outcomes only if we allow
                  them to influence our thoughts and actions. If we are focused
                  on what is in our control and what we can act on, it’s
                  imperative we achieve our goals.
                </p>

                <h3>Act (Kriya in Sanskrit):</h3>

                <p>
                  Last but not the least, you won’t achieve anything in life
                  until unless you act. Acknowledging and accepting an issue or
                  a limiting belief doesn’t help in overcoming it. If you are
                  content with where you are, you would at best acknowledge and
                  accept. You will start acting on finding ways to act on
                  limiting beliefs only when you have a compelling reason and
                  mindset to do so.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The best way to start acting on overcoming a limiting belief
                  is through:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Identifying the reasons/ assumptions driving that belief.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Validate the reasons/ assumptions to see how true they are.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The worst thing that could happen if those came true and any
                    benefits that could come out.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What you could achieve if those assumptions turn out to be
                    false and what you would experience when you do so?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    List out the actions that you are most comfortable to start
                    with (your best failproof action)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The positive outcome you get out of the most comfortable first
                  action gives you the strength to go further. Then it’s all
                  about consistency and persistence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Acting on a limiting belief give raise to greater awareness
                  which may bring out more limiting beliefs, unconscious biases
                  that have been limiting your growth and stopping you from
                  achieving your full potential. The framework can be reused as

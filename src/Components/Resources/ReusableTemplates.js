                <p>
                  Coaching is an essential part of the Agile process, which many
                  people believe to be more effective than traditional planning.
                  However, coaching is not a simple task and requires the right
                  tools. Most Agile coaches use a set of collaborative tools to
                  facilitate the coaching process.{" "}
